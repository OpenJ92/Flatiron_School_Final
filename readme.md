## to-Do
### Dense Neural Network player_state -f-> action:  (in Progress)
see: ML.py and ML_Sc.py and TreeBot.py for initial experiments
### Weighted Vector Space on strategy to construct 'Newtonian Gravitational field' to make decision player_state -f-> action: (in Progress)
see: under construction
### Construct Convolutional data from player A perspective: (in Progress)
see: A way to capture known partial information of Player B Strategy (Estimate player B strategy) adjust own strategy accordingly ie change Weighted Vector Space.
