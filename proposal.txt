Proposal:

  What question/questions are you trying to solve?
      A) Can Statistical Analysis, and Machine Learning techniques aid in the development
          and maintenance of competitive online/offline gaming experiences?
                *) How can we use information about their play habits to adjust the software of our current game?
                *) Given the space of possible actions within our game, to what strategies are our players
                    drawn to (lead to 'winning' outcome)? What actions can our company take to expand the validity of other strategies?
      B) Provided complete game state information for any given player, can one design
          a 'Matchmaking' system to increase player enjoyment/retention?
      C) Is there a place for RL / NN frameworks for in game AI? (Theoretical) / (Answer after project)

  What are the outcomes you think you will find (could use mutually exclusive collectively exhaustive for this), and then so what?
      A) Statistical analysis on Sc2Replays of players from a variety of leagues.
          What is the distinction between those leagues?
          What are the predominant strategies taken by individuals from any given league?
      B) Classification of player league and Matchmaking System
      C) Construction of the foundations of and RL learner.

  How would someone, or some entity take action upon learning this?
      A) An analysis of player behavior in a game is actionable by the developer of the game
      B) Implement Matchmaking System into competitive video-game
      B) One might abstract these processes to any domain. **

  What version this question would allow me to find an answer in 2-3 days?
      A) Can Statistical Analysis, and Machine Learning techniques aid in the development
          and maintenance of competitive online/offline gaming experiences?

  What version of this question would allow me/motivate me to work on this problem even after completing Flatiron School?
      A) Is there a place for RL / NN frameworks for in game AI? (Theoretical) / (Answer after project)

  What are some data sources that would allow you to answer this?

          Bronze       https://gggreplays.com/matches#?average_league=0&game_type=1v1&page=166 ~1660 total

                      -- Complete

  What is the ideal data you would hope to gather to answer this question?
      A) Gameplay data -- How does the population play our game?

  Potentially missing data, that could cause omitted variable bias?
      A) Interpolation?

  What will be the web component of your final project?
      A) Flask/Dash - Display information per player // per race // per league // etc...

  Will you create a Flask web app? Dash?
      A) Yes. The dataset is well formed for Object Relational Mapping. -- StepOne
                Player <<-->> Game
                State <<---> Game
                Player <-->> State
                      Game: (Players, Map)
                      Player: ()

  How will you use regression and classification?
      A) Classification -- (What league are you in? / How can we identify fallbacks and indicate to the player on how to improve?)
                          Matchmaking System via (RF // NN // NearN // etc...)
      B) Regression -- (In preparation RL learner) -- Construction of inhibitor functions on random agent bot.
                          Inhibitor System via (time dependent second order Logistic regressions on attack patterns)
                                               (time dependent nth/log order regression on Economy/Army metrics)

  What are the challenges you foresee with this project?
      A) *** Time Management -- Make a plan!

  What are your next steps moving forward?
      A) Construction of RL learner to play Sc2.
